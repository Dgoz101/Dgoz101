## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Hello,
My name is David Gosney an I am a current Senior at Brigham Young University - Idaho. I am studying for my bachelor's in computer science
and am hoping to get my master's in cybersecurity in the future. I am interested in technology advancements as well as sports. Networking, 
hardware, cybersecurity are just a few of the technologies that I have a strong interest in. I have learned multiple languages such as pyhton,
C#, CSS, Java, HTML, SQL, etc. I am continuing to hone my skills and learn new languages. Some of my favorite projects can be found in my 
CSE 210 repository including the Develop 6 project. It functions as a tracker to keep  track of goals that people have and reward them with
points for completing them.
