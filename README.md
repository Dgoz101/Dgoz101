Hello,
My name is David Gosney an I am a current junior at Brigham Young University - Idaho. I am studying for my bachelor's in computer science
and am hoping to get my master's in cybersecurity in the future. I am interested in technology advancements as well as sports.
I have learned multiple languages such as pyhton, C#, CSS, Java, HTML, SQL, etc. I am continuing to hone my skills and learn new languages.
Some of my favorite projects can be found in my CSE 210 repository including the Develop 6 project. It functions as a tracker to keep track
of goals that people have and reward them with points for completing them.
